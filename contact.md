I buy all wines unless otherwise noted, usually from retailers around my home. I do receive samples from time to time, marked by an asterisk on their accompanying posts, and I make an effort to taste and discuss them in a timely manner. 

I taste all wines with a variety of foods, companions, and entertainment accompaniments––in short, in a diverse array of settings––and I always include this context in my posts. I do not score wines.

I am available for freelance writing projects; see my [selected works](/writing.html)
for a range of subjects. I also do wine classes for groups, businesses, and events.
