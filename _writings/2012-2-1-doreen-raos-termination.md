When Robert Kiersz, a thirty-year member of the Buffalo Philharmonic Chorus, is asked about former Music Director Doreen Rao, he doesn’t hesitate to express his admiration. “Doreen is extraordinary,” he says. “The talent she brings, the knowledge, the background, and just her personality––she’s so giving, such an excellent teacher.”
It’s high praise for the woman who was terminated from her post as music director of the Buffalo Philharmonic Chorus on January 18—without, the chorus says, any explanation from the board of directors.
