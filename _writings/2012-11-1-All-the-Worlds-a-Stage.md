When I used to tell people I wanted to be a writer, the immediate response from older writers was invariably, “Lots of people think they want to be writers. If you could be happy doing anything else—anything at all—do that instead.” If, instead of just waving off harsh words, wannabes could spend a day, week, or month in the trenches—reading rejection after cold rejection, organizing millions of receipts to amass tax write-offs, searching endlessly for affordable health insurance—the profession wouldn’t seem quite so glamorous. And if being a wordsmith isn’t for the faint of heart, being a chef is only for the toughest of the tough: constant pressure, excruciating hours in a hot kitchen, and a work schedule that precludes any sort of normal social life, all to feed strangers who may or may not understand what you’re trying to do.
