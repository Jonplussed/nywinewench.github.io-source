On Thursday Texas Governor Rick Perry expressed his determination to pass Senate Bill 5, the Texas bill that would effectively shut down all but a handful of abortion clinics in the state––and he has advice for Senator Wendy Davis, who bravely filibustered the bill on Tuesday.

Telling the National Right to Life convention that “it's important to remember while we are under an obligation to protect the health and safety of people who live here, we are under no obligation to make things easier for the abortionist," Perry demonstrated his concern for women’s health and safety by admonishing Davis, who was raised by a single mother and put herself through Harvard Law despite having had a child at 19.
