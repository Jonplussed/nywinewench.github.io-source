Many people resolve to drink less come New Year's Day. A few days of post–holiday season liver pampering aside, I generally resolve to drink more: more of a new varietal I've discovered, more of a certain winemaker, or perhaps more at a favorite wine bar where there's always something interesting on the shelf.

2013 was a solid wine year for me; there was a wide variety to experience, from [Vilafonte 2007](http://stellenbauchery.com/blog/11-22-2013/disney-world.html) to a lovely [Bodegas Juan Gil](http://www.bodegasjuangil.com/) Honoro Vera monastrell from the cheese shop in my new hometown to that bottle of 2007 [Peconic Bay](http://www.peconicbaywinery.com/) Lowerre Family Reserve I've been keeping stashed away. I've gotten to try some Wisconsin-made wines, too, and it's been enough to stoke my curiosity about making my own next harvest. And at Christmas, my family and I enjoyed [Thelema's](http://www.thelema.co.za/) 2010 Mountain Red, a great value and terrific cheese and charcuterie partner with elderberry and plum notes, light tannins, and a little crackle of white pepper. 

I have a few ideas for making 2014 an even better wine year, however, and to hold myself accountable I'll list them here:

- **Drink more Wisconsin wine.**
Marquette! Frontenac port! Muscat! Seyval! There are so many interesting Wisconsin grapes. And I want to try them all.
- **Find and drink more South African merlot and malbec.** 
They're just so good, and it's not easy to find them at shops and restaurants. This is a job for online ordering, and I'll make a point to seek them out.
- **Drink more things made by [Elisabetta Foradori](http://www.elisabettaforadori.com/).** 
I love everything she makes so far, especially her nosiola and the teroldego, pictured above, that I tried last month. The owner of my local wine shop is a fan, so I'll be seeking out more of this outstanding Italian winemaker's work in 2014.
- **Make at least two different wines this fall.** 
I'm dying to experiment more with these less familiar grapes, and I want to become a better winemaker in general, so this fall will be a serious winemaking season for me.
- **Drink more Swartland.** Every Swartland syrah I've ever tried has been a stunner, and I want more––and more mourvedre, and chenin, and cinsault. Expect to see a lot of this up-and-coming region on the site this year.
