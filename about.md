title: About Julia Burke

I am a writer with a special interest in social justice. I also happen to
love wine, beer, and food. 

In 2008 I wandered into a [Western New York winery](http://www.freedomrunwinery.com/)
for a tasting and left with a job. In the small wine community of Niagara
County, then in its infancy, I discovered a passion for wine, and as I helped
clean tanks, pour for customers, and harvest grapes, I began to dream about
making my own.

In 2010, eager to continue my wine education, I traveled to Stellenbosch,
South Africa, for a harvest internship at [Blaauwklippen Vineyards](http://www.blaauwklippen.com/),
and this blog was born. I chronicled my wine adventures as well as observations about
South Africa’s extraordinarily rich culture; once again, I found myself
deeply in love.

Here in the US, I am constantly seeking great South African wine, and I
keep an eye on the South African wine industry; you’ll find [ample discussion of both](/blog)
here. As of fall 2015, I'm also a buyer at a small wine retailer in the great city of Chicago, so I'll be writing about interesting things I learn and find at work, too.

I am fascinated with the ways wine intersects with society, history,
politics, science, and popular culture, and [this blog](/blog) is my space to sort my
thoughts, share my ideas, and air my grievances on these topics. 

# Cheers!
